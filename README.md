_**"Welcome to Aliens Invasion! The Milky Way has been attacked by hostile creatures. You have been chosen by the Starfleet general to be the captain of the "Eagle 2" spaceship. The Eagle 2 is the best spaceship of Starfleet and one of the engineering miracles. The Eagle 2 has a modern guidance system and hypersonic missiles, which should help shoot aliens down. You cannot allow aliens to arrive on Earth. We believe in You."**_

# **What is this?**
**This is a simple 2D game where the player takes on the role of the captain of the "Eagle 2" spaceship. The player's task is not to allow aliens to arrive on Earth. For this purpose, the Eagle 2 is equipped with hypersonic bullets, enabling it to shoot aliens down and probably save Earth if the player is skilful enough. The game core is one of the projects proposed in "_Python Crash Course_" by Eric Matthes, but the whole game was significantly enhanced by me.**

# **Game Control**
**In the game, one has three difficulty levels. The default mode where we lead the game is "Outer Arm", one of the Milky Way arms. That mode corresponds to a medium difficulty level. The remaining levels are "Perseus Arm" (easy) and "Norma Arm" (hard). Each of these levels corresponds to a different number of aliens, the number of allowed bullets fired in one moment, spaceships, and aliens' downwards speed. These levels can be changed in the game settings.**
